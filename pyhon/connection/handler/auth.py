### Explanation of Changes:
- The Rust `Arc` and `Mutex` constructs are replaced with Python's built-in capabilities, as Python's `httpx` client is already designed to be used in an asynchronous context.
- The `intercept` method is designed to accept a callable for the HTTP method, similar to the Rust version.
- The `async` and `await` keywords are used to handle asynchronous operations in Python.
- The `get_called_urls` and `set_called_urls` methods are provided to manage the list of called URLs.
- The user agent string is set in the headers, and you should replace `"Your User Agent Here"` with the actual user agent string you want to use.
